# Virus-infector (v.1)

Simple proof of concept. Will return back to this project later...

./compile

./infect <target_file>


# To do
      1. Add functionality to infect Shared Dyn object files
      2. Make a self replicating payload small enough to fit in biggest code cave
      3. Ability to split the payload into smaller code caves all over the file
